Check the way how we have linked the css file to html file. We could have done the other way but we have done this way because if somehow we need to change the folder of css files, we need to change the links in all html files.Biut if we had opted for this method, we only need just one command to change the default directory.

Note the way we pass variables to html templates. Inside a html template {{ }} is used for a variable name to be displayed and {% %} for non

As a result, it becomes a canonical URL. Hence, using /python or /python/ returns the same output.
However, in case trailing slash is not used,using /python/ will return error.
