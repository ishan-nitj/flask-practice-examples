Check the way how we have linked the css file to html file. We could have done the other way but we have done this way because if somehow we need to change the folder of css files, we need to change the links in all html files.Biut if we had opted for this method, we only need just one command to change the default directory.

Note the way we pass variables to html templates. 

The Jinga2 template engine uses the following delimiters for escaping from HTML:
{% ... %} for Statements
{{ ... }} for Expressions to print to the template output
{# ... #} for Comments not included in the template output
# ... ## for Line Statements

If a trailing slash (/) is used like in :@app.route('/python/')
As a result, it becomes a canonical URL. Hence, using /python or /python/ returns the same output.
However, in case trailing slash is not used,using /python/ will return error.
